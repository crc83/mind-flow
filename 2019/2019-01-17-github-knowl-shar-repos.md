# Github Knowledge Sharing Resources
> **tags**: | github | java | python | data science | machine learning | interview | algorithms |

I've notice very interesting tendency on Github - people likes to share non-code repos. The most popular is "awersome" and "interview preparation" repos.
I have collected some amount of these repos.
